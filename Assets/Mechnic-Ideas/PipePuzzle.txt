Pipes are a grid.
each pip can be rotated in 4 directions
each has at least two sides
the active sides are diffined in a struct that has 4 bools up,down,left,right. Struct also contains a enum called rotation(0,1,2,3).

pip rotation 0 is default position.


in pip rot 0 up is open
in pip rot 1 left is open
in pip rot 2 down is open
in pip rot 3 right is open

rotating once more causes up to be open again.

how to logicaly figure this out
